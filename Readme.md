# Binary Files for Propeller Board

These files are required for building and running code on the Parallax Propeller board.

Unfortunately, Parallax has abandoned support for Linux, as can be seen from this thread:

I am very sad about this, but it seems we can limp along by using [copies of old code releases](https://web.archive.org/web/20161005174013/http://learn.parallax.com/tutorials/language/propeller-c/propeller-c-set-simpleide/linux).

I've dumped files here in hopes that they will survive the ravages of time at least as long as the Propeller Board does.

Note that not all of these files are from Parallax. They are all abandoned code though.
